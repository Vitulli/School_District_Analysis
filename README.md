# PyCity School District High School Analysis

## Overview

PyCity School District Board members have tasked the Analytics Department to do assess the pass / fail rate of students in Math and Reading 
    based on several factors such as High School, Grade, and to some extent,  budget per student.
    
## Process and Analysis
    
    The district provided the data for analysis.  It was initially assumed that this data has 
    been correctly collected and there is no large-scale issue with it; however, during the analysis
    it was brought to the attention of the team that there may be irregularities regarding Thomas High 
    School's 9th grade class and hence the testing data for both math and reading  has been struck from
    overall data set.  This will introduce an error in the data at both the Thomas High School level and
    the district level as well.
   
    The data was then sorted along the following:
    
      -School Summary
          -Aggregated across grade level.  No filtering.
      -High and Low Performing Schools
          -Aggregated across grade level. Top 5 and Bottom 5 schools.
      -Math and Reading Scores by Grade
          -Sorted only by subject Math or Reading.
      -Score by Schoolâ€™s Spending
          -Four distinct per student spending bins.
      -Scores by School Size
          -Three bin sizes.
      -Scores by School Type
          -Two bins.
